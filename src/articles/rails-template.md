A few months ago, [I blogged about my process of setting up a new rails
app][cs].

Since then, I've created three or four rails apps by following those steps.
This week I was following those steps manually yet again, so I decided to
automate it.

I created a new rails app, followed those steps manually, and published the
resulting repository:

<https://github.com/hugopeixoto/rails-template>

Now whenever I want to create a new app, I can start from this repository.

I created one commit per step, roughly, so it's easier to understand what going
on. To avoid having the list of commits growing with time as gems get updated,
I will probably amend changes of making new commits.
