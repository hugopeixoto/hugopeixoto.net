I spent most of October focused on ANSOL projects. I also found some time to
play around with PeerTube and setup an instance focused on portuguese content:
<https://viste.pt>

## October accomplishments

I edited and published four episodes of [Conversas em
Código](https://conversas.porto.codes) this month (one per week). Let's see if
I can keep up the pace during November.

The D3 project was put on hold, thanks to an issue with a third party.

I'm practically finished with [ANSOL](https://ansol.org)'s website rewrite. I started out with the
[Academic theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-academic/) but tweaked it
up to a point where it's basically its own theme right now. Now I need to get
this reviewed, migrate some content that was created on Drupal during October,
and ship it.

Thanks to a Hacktoberfest event organized by [Pedro Pinto
Silva](https://pedropintosilva.com/), I made [a few
contributions](https://github.com/CollaboraOnline/online/pulls?q=author%3Ahugopeixoto)
to [Collabora Online](https://collaboraonline.github.io/). It was my first time
working with this codebase, but their "Easy Hacks" issues were a good starting
point. The team was super helpful and responsive.

I edited and published [ANSOL's 20th year anniversary celebration
event](https://ansol.org/20anos) presentations. We were having some trouble
uploading them to [archive.org](https://archive.org), so I decided to setup a
personal [PeerTube](https://joinpeertube.org/) instance. The archive.org
problems were fixed, so we didn't use this instance, but I decided to keep it
anyway. I'm planning on mirroring the videos from [Porto
Codes](https://porto.codes) and maybe even upload the audio from [Conversas em
Código](https://conversas.porto.codes). I also contributed some pt-PT translations.


## Viste.pt

The PeerTube instance is available at <https://viste.pt>.

I'm still not sure what I'll do with this instance, but it'll be focused on
portuguese content. So if you want to start publishing some videos and want to
avoid companies like YouTube, send me a message and we can discuss hosting them
here.


## November plans

I want to keep publishing weekly podcast episodes during November. I also want
to write a blog post other than the status update, since I kind of stopped
writing them.

I'll push to get ANSOL's new website deployed and then focus on other projects.

I'm thinking of recording a couple of introductory videos on
[Matrix](https://matrix.org) and other federated networks in Portuguese.
