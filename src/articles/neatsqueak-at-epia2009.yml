  > Dear Hugo Peixoto, We have the pleasure to inform you that your contribution

  > optimization of a simulated robot* (paper #131) submitted to EPIA'2009 has been
  > accepted for presentation at the conference in Aveiro, October 12-15, 2009, and
  > publication in the conference proceedings.

  Somehow, we're in. Our first
  [NEATSqueak](http://hugopeixoto.net/neatsqueak.html) related paper got
  accepted!

  This paper is the result of our work done during the Robotics course. It
  focuses on the application of *unsupervised* learning methods to the
  [Ciber-Rato](http://microrato.ua.pt/) competition. We developed a
  neural network to control a simple robot so that he follows a set of points.

  I don't know how it got accepted; we were *severely* bashed on most of the four
  reviews and our work was very simple, not even suitable for a conference. We
  were just aiming at getting a good grade on our course.

  Now we need to review a couple of issues, and we'll be presenting it in
  October, at *EPIA'2009*. I really hope we don't get flamed much during the
  discussion.
