title: Recompiling firefox to change some keyboard shortcuts
created_at: 2020-07-14

I'm trying to migrate from [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/) to
[Firefox](https://mozilla.org/firefox/new).

One of the things that caught me by surprise is that the keyboard shortcuts to
select the n-th tab are different. In chromium, they're `Ctrl+1` through
`Ctrl+9`, while in firefox they're `Alt+1` through `Alt+9`. These shortcuts
conflict with the ones I'm using in [sway](https://swaywm.org/), where they're
used to navigate between workspaces.

This is not fixable via a setting change, so I decided to build a custom
version of firefox. Since I'm using debian, this should be straightforward:

~~~~
$ sudo apt build-dep firefox    # install build dependencies
$ apt source firefox            # download source package
$ cd firefox-78.0.2/
$ make-necessary-changes-to-files
$ dpkg-source --commit          # create a patch file and changes version
$ dpkg-buildpackage -us -uc     # build the deb files
~~~~

I was having some trouble finding what changes to make, though, and firefox's
codebase is not exactly small. [tokei](https://github.com/XAMPPRocky/tokei)
reports ~200k files and ~27M lines of code. `ack`ing didn't help much, so I
cloned the source repository to see if I could find something through the
commit messages. Firefox uses mercurial, but there's an official git mirror:

<https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Git>

> The current official git mirror of the Firefox code base (also known as
> "gecko" or "mozilla-central") can be found at
> <https://github.com/mozilla/gecko-dev>.

After some tries, I found this:

~~~~
$ git log --grep "Ctrl+9"

    Bug 338348: Make Ctrl+9 select the last tab instead of the ninth tab, patch
    by Simon BÃ¼nzli <zeniko@gmail.com>, r=mconnor

The second commit was a good starting point. The code had changed a lot since
that commit in 2006, but I was able to track it down by looking to the files
history with a combination of `git log -p <filename>` and `git show <commit-sha>`.
I ended up doing the following change:

~~~~diff

~~~~

By removing the `ifdef`, it now always uses `accel`. It took roughly one hour
to compile and it generated a bunch of deb files:

~~~~
$ ls -1 *.deb
firefox-dbgsym_78.0.2-1.1_amd64.deb
firefox-l10n-ach_78.0.2-1.1_all.deb
firefox-l10n-af_78.0.2-1.1_all.deb
[...]
firefox-l10n-zh-cn_78.0.2-1.1_all.deb
firefox-l10n-zh-tw_78.0.2-1.1_all.deb
firefox_78.0.2-1.1_amd64.deb
~~~~

I installed the last one via `dpkg -i firefox_78.0.2-1.1_amd64.deb`, restarted
firefox, and it works!

Not sure how I'll keep recompiling firefox every time there's a new firefox
version. This doesn't seem like something that would be accepted upstream. I
didn't see any keyboard shortcuts on that file whose modifiers depend on a
configuration setting.

It would probably have been easier to install [an extension for
this](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ctrl-number-to-switch-tabs/).

Here are some firefox bug reports and commits related to this keyboard shortcut
that I found along the way:
