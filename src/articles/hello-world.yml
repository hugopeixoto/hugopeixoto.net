  Obligatory first post.

  So, I decided to start a blog. Why? I guess I just want to have a place where I
  can register my random projects and experiments. Come to think of it, I believe
  that most developers like talking about what they do &mdash; but nobody wants
  to listen. Hence the great number of developer blogs.

  With this in mind, I'm planning on writing small and simple posts on what I'm
  currently working on. An [OpenID](http://openid.net) provider implementation at
  [FEUP](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/pt/web_page.inicial), A.I. experiments, or
  something else that randomly pops into my interest.
