excerpt:
  RailsBridge BugMash
body: |
  During the past weekend, the Rails team organized a *BugMash* with the help of
  the [*RailsBridge*](http://railsbridge.org/) community. More than 180 tickets
  from [Rails
  Lighthouse](https://rails.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8994-ruby-on-rails/tickets?q=all)
  were chosen and targeted during the past 48 hours.

  They were even able to gather a few prizes to raffle off. The more
  contributions you made, the higher the chance to win something. About *120
  tickets were solved* during this joint effort and a few new bugs were
  discovered, so I'd say that this initiative was pretty successful.

  I was able to commit 6 patches to both 2.3-stable and master branches. A part
  of me will be in Rails 3.0! Neat, huh? I had lots of fun digging around mostly
  through activerecord and actionpack. I also had the opportunity to get in touch
  with [*git*](http://www.git-scm.org/) &mdash; branching, patching and whatnot.
  Lets see if I can win some cute books!
