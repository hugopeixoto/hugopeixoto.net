During March I finished and submitted the ink upgradeability project for
review, struggled with linux to play pokémon TCG online, and spent some time
looking for a new apartment.

## ink! upgradeability gig

I've submitted the project for evaluation, and already got some requests for
change: <https://github.com/w3f/Grant-Milestone-Delivery/pull/126>. I'll be
working to close this during April.


## Pokémon TCG

I casually returned to the pokémon TCG world. There's a digital version, so I
[got it running on Debian][hp-ptcgo]. I also started to digitize my collection,
and made a website to check what I'm missing:
<https://hugopeixoto.net/pokemon/tcg/missing.html>. This is a generated static
website and a scraper to get all of the images and sets. My git repository
currently mixes both the code and the data, so I can't publish it yet, but I'll
try to split it soon.
