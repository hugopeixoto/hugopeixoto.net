This month I took a break from Cyberscore to work on other projects. I was all
in on Pokémon stuff. I also took a week of vacations, which is why this update
is a bit late.

## August accomplishments

I worked on extracting the pokédex flavor texts from the 3DS game ROMs
(<https://github.com/hugopeixoto/ctr-rs>) and wrote a [blog post of the
process](/articles/data-mining-3ds-pokemon-games.html).

Before working on the pokédex extraction thing, I worked on a quick and dirty
tool to OCR the pokédex flavor entries from Pokémon cards, to help seed content
on <https://pkmncards.com>. This is available here:
<https://github.com/hugopeixoto/ptcg-ocr/>

I've also spent around a week's worth of time polishing and rehearsing for [my
talk for RustConf](https://rustconf.com/schedule/identifying-pok-mon-cards).
Initially I was going through the technical details of a bunch of algorithms,
but being limited to 15 minutes, I had to cut a lot and really focus on the
essentials. It was an interesting experiment, but it took forever. It's the
first talk I'm giving outside of [Porto codes](https://porto.codes), so that's
going to be fun. I hope people like it.


## September plans

My to-do list for September is kind of huge, not sure how I'm going to fit
everything in.

First, there's the actual RustConf talk, scheduled for the 14th.

There are a couple of <https://cyberscore.me.uk> important bugs that need
fixing, and I'd like to add user registration to <https://fzerocentral.org>, I
haven't worked on it in a while.

[AlumniEI's Mentorship program](https://mentor.alumniei.pt) is supposed to
launch this month, so I'll need to spend some time on it.

I also volunteered to work on a project for [D3](https://direitosdigitais.pt)
and a couple of [ANSOL](https://ansol.org) projects this month.

I wanted to work on extracting the pokédex flavor texts from the Switch games
and add them to [Veekun](https://veekun.com/dex), but I think it will have to
wait. I volunteered to do a C++ related talk in November, but I'll probably
only start working on it in October.

I'm getting stressed just looking at this list. I'll probably start with
Cyberscore and the mentorship program, since they're closed scope tasks and
kind of time critical, and then move to the D3 and ANSOL ones, since they're
are a bit more squishy and lengthy. Not sure where I'm going to fit F-Zero
Central. Getting this blog post out of the way is already a great help
kickstarting things.
