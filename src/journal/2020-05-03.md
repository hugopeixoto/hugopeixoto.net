Today's goal is to automate everything that's running on the server hosting
hugopeixoto.net.

I forgot to update the credit card number on my digital ocean account and
almost lost the server. This is not the first time something like this happens,
so I want to work towards reducing the anxiety from not having the servers
under control.

## Overview

I know I have a few website domains pointing to it:

- hugopeixoto.net: my homepage;
- git.hugopeixoto.net: self hosted git server;
- invite.porto.codes: slack invite page;
- invite.pokegopt.com: slack invite page;
- slack.ptgamedev.hugopeixoto.net: slack invite page;
- media.porto.codes: a place where I used to store <https://porto.codes> media
  files;
- traduz.debian.hugopeixoto.net: an old experiment to help translate debian
  packages to portuguese;
- recipes.hugopeixoto.net: a diary of recipes I cooked, in case I want to
  repeat them.

I will decommission some of these.

The only file in `/root/`, apart from random dot files, is `colorcheck.sh`.
That script is already versioned in
<https://github.com/hugopeixoto/dotfiles/blob/master/bin/colorcheck>, so this
seems clean.

## hugopeixoto.net

This is being served of `/srv/www/hugopeixoto.net/public`. Most of its content
comes from compiling <https://github.com/hugopeixoto/hugopeixoto.net>, but I
know I also use it as a temporary sharing place for random files. Let's see how
much do I have in unversioned content here:

~~~~terminal?prompt=$,#&output=plaintext%3ftoken=Text&lang=plaintext%3ftoken=Generic.Strong

269M    .

hugopeixoto@laptop:~/w/p/hugopeixoto.net$ du -sh build/
568K    build/
~~~~

So, ~270 megabytes of unversioned stuff. I think it's mostly previews of the
porto codes talks I was editing.

I can delete these preview files. I have the original stuff, I don't need
these. Some of them are accidentally sped up, which is kind of funny, but I
probably won't look at this again.

Better. Let's look at what's left:

~~~~terminal?prompt=$,#&output=plaintext%3ftoken=Text&lang=plaintext%3ftoken=Generic.Strong

`2020-05-03.txt` is this file, which I'm hosting here temporarily. It's already
version controlled, so no problem there. `wat.html` was a way to get some
javascript online to test some properties on different mobile browsers.
Trashed.

I'm left with `mob/`, `talks/`, and `screenshots/`. The first one contains a
asciinema of something I was working on, related to makeorbreak.io. I have the
.cast file backed up on my `work/makeorbreak.io/` directory, and whomever
needed to see this has already done so. Trashing it as well. `screenshots/` is
a workaround while I don't re-setup my image sharing service. These are all
trash. Removing them. `talks/` contains the slides of a presentation I worked
on last week. I shared these with some folks, so I want to keep this for now.

Still a bit over the `568K`. Turns out I have a `images/` directory inside the
`images/` directory, due to a bug in my homepage's build system. Removing it.

Close enough. The difference is probably related to block sizes. Let's be sure:

Confirmed. There was no relevant content that needed to be backed up in this
directory, yay!

Let's continue exploring `/srv/www/`:

I'm using `default/` to handle let's encrypt certificate confirmations.
`git.hugopeixoto.net` has some `cgit` files. I remember something about `cgit`
having a vulnerability. Let's look that up.

## git.hugopeixoto.net

OK, it seems like there was a directory traversal bug in 2018:
<https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2018-14912/>

My cgit version seems to be from 2015. Uff. There are three more
vulnerabilities in 2016. I don't even know how I got this configured. There
seems to be no cgit source in `/srv/`, nor in `/home/git/`. I must have
compiled it on my desktop or laptop and rsynced the binary there. Searching.
I usually keep third party software sources in `$HOME/work/contrib/`.

Confirmed. Found it on an old hard drive that held my desktop's installation:

Quite old. Good thing it's not running. I have a systemd service description
for cgit in `/lib/systemd/system/cgit.service`, but it doesn't start
automatically. I am tempted to start it temporarily just to see if that's
enough to bring it back up. Yep, it worked. I brought it back down again,
though.

Do I want to keep this? My goal with cgit was to keep a copy of my git
repositories outside of github, and to have a place where to keep private
repositories (back when github was only for public stuff). Do I still care
about that? I had gitolite set up to allow a couple of friends to collaborate
with me, but I think that if I were to do this today, we'd all be using github.

What are the downsides of maintaining this? It's another piece of software to
update. What if I try an alternative to `cgit`? I know that there is a tool
that generates a static website, instead of serving it live. Found it:

Stagit: <https://git.codemadness.org/stagit/>

On one hand, serving this as static files sounds tempting and easier to
maintain. On the other hand, I'll lose a bunch of features. But I don't really
use this at all, so does it matter?

Let's see if cgit is in the repositories.

~~~~terminal?prompt=$,#&output=plaintext%3ftoken=Text&lang=plaintext%3ftoken=Generic.Strong

Seems like it. I'll remove my custom built version and install this one. Moving
to stagit would require some time to set it up and some decision paralysis
would surely pop up.

Hm, `/home/cgit/` has a `.well-known/` directory. Is `/srv/www/` a symlink to `/home/cgit/`?

Wat. Why is hugopeixoto.net owned by the git user? Anyway, git.hugopeixoto.net
does not seem to be a symlink. Let me check if the directory is referenced
somewhere in `/etc/`.

Huh, do I have both `nginx` and `apache2` installed?

~~~~terminal?prompt=$,#&output=plaintext%3ftoken=Text&lang=plaintext%3ftoken=Generic.Strong
root@server:/srv/www# dpkg -l | grep apache
~~~~

OK, it's not installed. It was just `cgit` that placed a config there, in case
I ever install it. Thanks, I guess. Not sure if I can remove
`/etc/init/cgit.conf`. That's a file I wrote, and there doesn't seem to be
anything set up by default by the `cgit` package. I'm guessing they're
expecting me to use it with apache and let it manage the process instead of
having a standalone fcgi service. That's fine. Let me update the config to point to the newly installed files:

~~~~terminal?prompt=$,#&output=plaintext%3ftoken=Text&lang=plaintext%3ftoken=Generic.Strong
# diff /etc/init/cgit.conf.old /etc/init/cgit.conf

---

I should also check the `cgitrc` file.

~~~~

So I had a bunch of configs. I need to tweak this, then.

OK, that didn't work. I copied most of the old config onto the new path,
reloaded the systemd configuration with `systemd daemon-reload`, and started
it, but the logs tell me that it "failed to bind: address already in use".

Running `lsof -i` and `netstat -ln` doesn't seemto show aything bound to 3001. There is this, though:

~~~~terminal?prompt=$,#&output=plaintext%3ftoken=Text&lang=plaintext%3ftoken=Generic.Strong
unix  2      [ ACC ]     STREAM     LISTENING     10571    /run/fcgiwrap.socket

Could it be related?

~~~~terminal?prompt=$,#&output=plaintext%3ftoken=Text&lang=plaintext%3ftoken=Generic.Strong
root@server:/srv/www# lsof | grep fcgiwrap

~~~~

No clue what's going on. Why is this bound to PID 1? OK, I'm rebooting this.

Rebooted, I can still get in. The lsof thing is still there. Maybe it's
unrelated. Running `service cgit start` starts cgit from the old `/home/` path.
Am I editing the wrong service definition?

There's still a reference to the old filename in
`/etc/nginx/sites-available/git.hugopeixoto.net`. Is this related somehow? I
don't think it is, because of this:

~~~~terminal?prompt=$,#&output=plaintext%3ftoken=Text&lang=plaintext%3ftoken=Generic.Strong

~~~~

The line looks like what was stored in `/etc/init/cgit.conf`. Is it storing a cached version somewhere? Am I misremembering how to reload systemd definitions?

From <https://serverfault.com/questions/700862/do-systemd-unit-files-have-to-be-reloaded-when-modified>:

> After you make changes to your unit file, you should run systemctl daemon-reload [...].

This is what I remembered, but it doesn't seem to work. I replaced the exec
line with `exec yes` and it still shows up the fcgiwrap thing. Let's try to see
what systemd thinks it knows (<https://linuxhint.com/list_service_systemd/>).

OK, got it. `/lib/systemd/system/cgit.service`. This contains outdated
information. Am I supposed to edit this file directly? I don't think so. Should
this be a symlink to `/etc/init/cgit.conf`? Nginx does not seem to be a
symlink, for example. Checking my history:

~~~~terminal?prompt=$,#&output=plaintext%3ftoken=Text&lang=plaintext%3ftoken=Generic.Strong

Well this is suspicious. I created those files manually, for some reason. Why
did I have /etc/init/cgit.conf? Was this from when I used upstart? Googling
again.

So, to start with, I should have probably have added this to
/etc/systemd/system/, not /lib/systemd/system/`. But what's up with
`/etc/init/`?

This confirms it. Moving slackin and cgit to `/etc/systemd/system/` and
removing those copies in /etc/init/.

18:14. Taking a longer break.
19:37. Back for a short period of time.

Oh, I had something referencing `/home/git/cgit` in nginx. Let me quickly fix
that. It worked.

Now I'm missing CSS and the logo. This will be tweaking /etc/cgitrc and
potentially change nginx to serve some files from cgit's installation.

~~~~terminal?prompt=$,#&output=plaintext%3ftoken=Text&lang=plaintext%3ftoken=Generic.Strong
root@server:~# find /usr/ -name cgit.css
/usr/share/cgit/cgit.css
root@server:~# ls /usr/share/cgit/
cgit.css  cgit.png  favicon.ico  robots.txt
~~~~

I can point nginx directly to `/usr/share/cgit/` and add my logo there. I don't
like overriding something in `/usr/`, though. Does nginx support multiple
roots? I can always use `try_files`.

So, the `<img>` tag currently points to `https://git.hugopeixoto.net/cgit-css/cgit.png`.
This matches the `/etc/gitrc` `css=css/cgit.css` config. I'm just copying over
the files I need into my `/srv/www/git.hugopeixoto.net/public/` directory and be
done with it.

I'm definitely creating either a docker image or a git repository to store
these configs, logos and css. The font seems a bit small by default, so I will
probably have to tweak that as well.

Making a git repo now. I had a repo for the gitolite stuff, should I use the
same? Maybe I'll unify these in the future, but I'm starting with separate ones
for now.

How do I add a new repo to this, again? Checking a clone of a repo I know it's
there, on an old drive.

Cool, it tries to connect with an old SSH key, and I don't remember the
passphrase. Trying a few. No luck so far. I could replace it with a fresh key,
but I'm going to obsess over not knowing this passphrase. It's not on my
password manager.

22:20 I'll continue tomorrow.
00:05 Back, still trying to remember it.

Trying to see if I accidentally typed it in bash, where I can find it in
bash_history.

> ssh git.hugopeixoto.net -lroot
> ssh-add ~/.ssh/ndrive_rsa

Right, thanks :x I'm just looking at my keyboard trying to conjure the
passphrase out of thin air. Attempting to brute force a couple of attempts, and
logging every attempt so that I don't try them all again tomorrow.

I got nothing. Moving on, let's try again tomorrow.

Going back to git.hugopeixoto.net, it's now up again. It seems that
repositories are in /home/git/repositories. What else lives in this home
directory that can be deleted?

There's the `hpeixoto.pub` again. This is yet another copy of the pubkey whose
private key I can't unlock. Teasing me. It seems that I used this to initialize gitolite:

I can probably remove this. I have tons of copies of this pubkey, and I
shouldn't be using it anyway.

Removing cgit, since it's the previous instalation location.

I can probablyremove projects.list. It's a file that lists a couple of
repositories. Oops, I renamed it. It's used by cgit to know which projects are
public, apparently. Confirmed,it's on cgitrc:

~~~~terminal?prompt=$,#&output=plaintext%3ftoken=Text&lang=plaintext%3ftoken=Generic.Strong
project-list=/home/git/projects.list
~~~~

Do I have to add an entry here every time? This sounds boring. This file is
probably handled by gitolite. Let me check the gitolite-admin repo. Ah, from
the gitolite documentation, this file is automatically written with a list of
repositories that have a gitweb configuration set.

Sounds dangerous. Nevertheless, this file doesn't need to be backed up or removed.
That leaves `bin/` and `gitolite/`, both related to gitolite's installation.

I feel like I'm done with the git part. The only thing left is to unlock that
cursed key.

What else is on `/srv/www/`?

## media.porto.codes

This is and old staging area for both porto codes and conversas em código
recordings. I probably backed them all up to S3. I have a copy on my desktop.
Let's see if I can match every file.

Same thing. So I can delete everything from the server, except `talks/`, as
it's already backed up. I hate this part, where I delete important things from
places.

Done. Now what's up with `talks/`? `ls` shows me a dozen or so files. This
should be quick. They look like old files, 2016 and older. Let's `sha256sum`
and search for their counterparts in my desktop.

I already see some matches. I'll store the desktop hashes in a file and search
for the server's hashes in there, one by one, manually. If everything has a
match, I'll delete the whole server directory.

Got a match for every file. That was quick. Deleting
`/srv/www/media.porto.codes/`. Checking for hidden files before pressing the
trigger. I'll also remove any nginx entries for this domain. I'll need to
remove it from the DNS as well, but that can wait.

What's left?

I set up `recipes` yesterday, so that's pretty clean. Slackin seems to be
working OK, so I'll just remove pokegopt's entry, since that doesn't exist
anymore. I should keep a copy of the settings file somewhere. Done.

Does `traduz` even work?

## traduz.debian.hugopeixoto.net

This seems to be a single binary server, so it's probably a go rewrite of my
original rails implementation.

When I access <https://traduz.debian.hugopeixoto.net/>, I can see the search
bar, but searching does nothing. The endpoint is returning 502. I also see some
react warnings. Cool.

Is there a systemd or upstart unit for this? Let's find out, now that I know
where to look.

~~~~terminal?prompt=$,#&output=plaintext%3ftoken=Text&lang=plaintext%3ftoken=Generic.Strong

chdir /srv/www/traduz.debian.hugopeixoto.net

Here we go again. I'll move the system one to the proper directory on `/etc/`.
A `daemon-reload` and `traduz start` after, it seems to work!

This is similar to what linguee does, but specific to debian package
translations. Also, older than linguee. :P

There's a `config/settings.json` file, which was a very common pattern in my
webservers ~5 years ago. The `public/` directory contains html and js, and the
`files/` directory contains the translation files.

I have no idea how the `files/` directory got here. Let's see if I have any
records of it in the desktop.

Found this in a random bash_history file:

~~~~terminal?prompt=$,#&output=plaintext%3ftoken=Text&lang=plaintext%3ftoken=Generic.Strong
rsync -r files root@git.hugopeixoto.net:/srv/www/traduz.debian.hugopeixoto.net/
~~~~

So this means I have a script to fetch these and I just sync them manually to
the server. There's a `fetcher/` directory here:
<https://github.com/hugopeixoto/debian-traduz>

I consider this backed up. So this means I'm done with /srv/www/.

## what else is missing?

No postgresql installed, no random files in user homes. I think the only thing
left is to decide what to do with the git server. I could also make sure that I
have copies of every repository that's hosted here.

This last part bothers me a lot. I always feel like I don't have a complete
mind map of all the stuff I created, and it never feels organized. Part of this
is what led me to create the `untracked` tool:

<https://github.com/hugopeixoto/untracked>

Do I want to move every service to a docker container? It kind of makes me sad,
but dealing with this /lib/ /etc/init/ systemd shenanigans kind of make me want
to do it.

I should have a private repository, or something, that allows me to easily
upload something to hugopeixoto.net for sharing. I do that a lot, just by
`rsync`ing random stuff, and I lose track of what's there fast.

There's also dl.hugopeixoto.net, my self-hosted version of cloudapp, which I'd
like to revive. But then I'd need to rebuild the android app, and having to
touch the android tooling makes me anxious. Last time I touched android stuff,
I tried to build an app inside a docker image, using only free software, but I
hit some issues with openjdk.

So, this is what's currently running on this server:

What tasks are left?

## endless todo material

- hugopeixoto.net/talks: automate the deployment and merge it with previous
  content
- figure out what to do with this (and future) journal entries, are they blog
  post entries?
- recipes.hugopeixoto.net: automate the deployment
- replace invite.porto.codes with a slack invite link (they support those now)
- check if the ptgamedev slack is dead and remove
  slack.ptgamedev.hugopeixoto.net
- check if debian translations are still fetchable by the current script or if
  there's an easier way
- get a cron job going that updates debian translations
- reconfigure dl.hugopeixoto.net, even if just to have a separate directory
  where to upload random files
- figure out what to do with git.hugopeixoto.net

Looking at this list, it looks like I didn't do much today. Weird.
